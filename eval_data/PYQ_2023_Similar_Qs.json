These frogs are rare and elusive for the reason that they are arboreal and active only for a few weeks during their breeding season.\nThe frog is endemic to the Western Ghats.\nThey exhibit unique breeding behaviour. The breeding season, unlike for other frogs, starts in the pre-monsoon season (May) and ends before the monsoon becomes fully active in June.\nAfter breeding and egg-laying, they retreat back to the high canopies of the tree and remain elusive till next breeding season.",

The globe skimmer dragonfly does not rely on fat stored in its body to fly such long distances. Instead, it takes advantage of favorable winds present during certain periods of the year.\nJacobin Cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus) is one of the most iconic migrants in the Indian Subcontinent, and their arrival in north India is considered to herald the first monsoon rains. Although resident in South India, central and northern populations of this brood parasite migrate to Africa for the winter.\nAmur Falcons migrate from breeding grounds in eastern Asia to wintering grounds in southern Africa. Along the way, they fly 2,400 miles across the Indian Ocean.",

                "reasoning": "When the government is going to the financial market to raise money, it can do it by issuing two types of debt instruments – treasury bills and government bonds. Treasury bills are issued when the government needs money for a shorter period while bonds are issued when it need debt for more than say five years. Treasury bills; generally shortened as T-bills, have a maximum maturity of 364 days. Hence, they are categorized as money market instruments (money market deals with funds with a maturity of less than one year). Treasury bills are presently issued in three maturities, namely, 91 day, 182 day and 364 day. Treasury bills are zero coupon securities and pay no interest. Rather, they are issued at a discount (at a reduced amount) and redeemed (given back money) at the face value at maturity. For example, a 91 day Treasury bill of Rs.100/- (face value) may be issued at say Rs. 98.20, that is, at a discount of say, Rs.1.80 and would be redeemed at the face value of Rs.100/-. This means that you can get a hundred-rupee treasury bill at a lower price and can get Rupees hundred at maturity. The return to the investors is the difference between the maturity value or the face value (that is Rs.100) and the issue price. The Reserve Bank of India conducts auctions usually every Wednesday to issue T-bills. The rational is that since their maturity is lower, it is more convenient to avoid intra period interest payments. Treasury bills are usually held by financial institutions including banks. They have a very important role in the financial market beyond investment instruments. Banks give treasury bills to the RBI to get money under repo. Similarly, they can keep it as part of SLR.",

The procedure to appoint the next CJI is laid out in the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) between the government and the judiciary. Vis-à-vis the appointment of the CJI and the appointment of SC judges, the key difference is that in the former, the government cannot send the recommendation of the CJI (or the collegium) back to them for reconsideration; while in the latter, the government can do so. The Memorandum of Procedure does not have any provision for the eventuality of the government disagreeing with the incumbent CJI’s recommendation on the new one.",

Petrol and diesel are hydrocarbons too, petrol being lighter. Petrol has only carbon and hydrogen, and very few nitrogen atoms. It typically has chains of nine carbon atoms; diesel mostly comprises chains of 14 carbon atoms. Emissions from diesel vehicles, especially particulate matter and black carbon, are the major reasons for air pollution as well. Sulphates, like sulphur dioxide, released in the atmosphere may lead to acid rain. Amid rising concern about global warming in the 1990s, many countries had started shifting to diesels because they did not produce CO2. Diesel is much more harmful than petrol because of the composition of the fuel. When it burns, diesel produces more pollutants.",

Sometimes earthquakes are referred to by the maximum intensity they produce.\nMagnitude scales, like the moment magnitude and Richter scale measure the size of the earthquake at its source.\nThe magnitude in richter scale is expressed in absolute numbers, 0-10.\nThe Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, meaning that each order of magnitude is 10 times more intensive than the last one.

                "reasoning": "Advantages of hydrogen as a fuel:\n\nHydrogen has the highest energy content of any common fuel by weight.\nIts usage can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thus help improve environmental quality. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe and despite the challenges associated with its extraction from water, it is a uniquely abundant and renewable source of energy, perfect for our future zero-carbon needs for combined heat and power supplies. Hydrogen can be produced from diverse domestic resources with the potential for near-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nChallenges in using hydrogen as a fuel:\n\nHydrogen’s energy content by volume is low. This makes storing hydrogen a challenge because it requires high pressures, low temperatures, or chemical processes to be stored compactly. Because hydrogen has a lower volumetric energy density than gasoline, storing this much hydrogen on a vehicle currently requires a larger tank at a higher pressure than other gaseous fuels.\nHydrogen has a wide range of flammable concentrations in air and lower ignition energy than gasoline or natural gas, which means it can ignite more easily.",

The name comes from Australia’s initiative to create the group. Australia manages the secretariat.\nThe initial members of the group had different assessments of which chemical precursors should be subject to export control. Later adherents initially had no such controls.\nToday, members of the group maintain export controls on a uniform list of 54 compounds, including several that are not prohibited for export under the Chemical Weapons Convention, but can be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons.\nThe first was the no-undercut requirement, which stated that any member of the group considering making an export to another state that had already been denied an export by any other member of the group must first consult with that member state before approving the export.\nThe second was the catch-all provision, which requires member states to halt all exports that could be used by importers in chemical or biological weapons programs, regardless of whether the export is on the group’s control lists.

However, it continues to grant asylum to a large number of refugees from neighbouring States and respects UNHCR’s mandate for other nationals, mainly from Afghanistan and Myanmar.",

The amendments ignore the fact that the two laws have completely different objectives. The RTI Act seeks to provide information to people, while the WBP Act provides a mechanism for disclosures to be made to competent authorities within the government to enable inquiry into allegations of corruption and provide protection to whistle-blowers.",
