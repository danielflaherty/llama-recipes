Consider the following statements with respect to Legislative Councils in India:

The creation of a Legislative Council requires both the legislative assembly of the concerned state and the Parliament to pass the resolution by a special majority.
The Legislative Council of a state shall not have more than half of the total strength of the State Assembly, and not less than 40 members.
Currently, seven states have a Legislative Council in India.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None of the above
Explain your reasoning, then output your answer at the end:

Reasoning:

Statement 1: The creation of a Legislative Council requires the Legislative Assembly of the concerned state to pass a resolution by a simple majority, not a special majority. The Parliament then also needs to pass an act for the creation. So, the statement is incorrect.

Statement 2: According to Article 169 of the Indian Constitution, the legislative council of a state shall not have more than one-third of total number of members in the legislative assembly of that state, and not less than 40 members. So, this statement is incorrect as well.

Statement 3: As of now, only six states in India have a legislative council: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. So, this statement is also incorrect.

So, none of the above statements are correct.

Consider the following statements:

Nomination of members to Rajya Sabha was taken from the Irish Constitution.
President can nominate two members to the Lok Sabha from the Anglo-Indian Community.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both
(d) Neither 1 nor 2
Explain your reasoning, then output your answer at the end:

Reasoning:

1. Nomination of members to Rajya Sabha was taken from the Irish Constitution: This is a correct statement. The Indian Constitution makers borrowed the idea of the nomination of members to the Rajya Sabha from the constitution of Ireland. So, the first part of the statement is correct.
2. President can nominate two members to the Lok Sabha from the Anglo-Indian Community: This statement was true, however, as per the 104th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2020, this provision has been abolished. So currently, the President can no longer nominate two members to the Lok Sabha from the Anglo-Indian Community. This means the second part of the statement is now incorrect.

Therefore, based on this analysis, only statement 1 is correct.
